# State the problem you are trying to solve

The internet is a massive resource which can provide an incredible amount of information, which can quickly become overwhelming. BrainCoffee is a means for people to quickly learn something new and interesting every day by browsing through a new fact with their morning cup of coffee. 

# Include a description of at least two types of users that would use your Web application

Students
Educators
Entrepreneurs

# For each of the types of users, provide two goals the user would like to achieve with your Web application

Students - General knowledge education, to satisfy curiosity.
Educators - Similar to students, but manages Classes of students in a “has many” relationship.
Entrepreneurs - Every random piece of knowledge can be valuable to an entrepreneur, gaining relevant industry knowledge

# State the overall strategy of how you intend to solve the problem:

Ask for user interests and depending on those interests, try to recommend a relevant wikipedia source or other relevant research resources. Use a wikipedia article reducer to create a relevant summary for the user to dip their toes in, before they can expand and read the entire article if they choose to.
Allow for the exploration of such a topic by looking through the links, try to host a wikipedia-like experience in our own application
User learning statistics (i.e. most researched tags, most researched categories) and a scoring system to quantify the uniqueness of the user’s research (as an incentive to read up on more unique topics) and other weighted aspects of user research).
Use this derived score to rank all users on the database and create a sort of leaderboard. A social media aspect may improve learning in users, which is the end goal of the app.


# One of the main requirements is to work with data available from some public, free, Web API. Provide a brief description of the Web API you intend to use:

The WikiPedia Api, Google scholar API - We will use both depending on user input and preferences. Separate APIs for platforms that aggregate records in a similar way may be used too, in order to provide the user with more choice and freedom of research.
