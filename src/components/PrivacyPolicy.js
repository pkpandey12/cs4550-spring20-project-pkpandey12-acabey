            <h3 className="card-body card-title">Our Purpose</h3>
            <p className="card-body text-justify">BrainCoffee exists solely to help people imbibe facts and factoids in a summarized manner
            which over time is our hope makes life easier for them. To this end, we believe our website 
            shouldn't exist as any more than just that. An aggregator for daily information, a personalized encyclopedia.
            We envision this to be a divergent discussion where one conversation leads effortlessly into another
            and you learn something the entire time.
            <br/>
            Ultimately, the data we collect from you should only serve to complement your learning in the long term. Hence, our privacy norms
            are strict. Mostly because we don't even collect any information other than what you provide us with and we will never share it with anyone.
            Our goal is to create a safe space for you to explore any topics you feel necessary and save them for later perusal. Your interest in topics,
            subjects and articles is of no interest to us so to speak. These data points only exist so that you can track your progress. All so you can
            measure how far you've come.
            </p>
            <h3 className="card-body card-title">The Data We Do Collect</h3>
            <p className="card-body text-justify">These are the datapoints we may collect from you:
            <ol>
               <li>
                   Your passwords, first and last names
               </li>
               <li>
                   The bites you've saved
               </li>
               <li>
                   The topics you've read
               </li>
            </ol>
            I will declare here that most of this data is not necessary for this website to function, so we will not be storing them in our databases to peruse.
            Indeed, all this data will be visible only to you, the user. In the longterm, we will make analytics available to you and connect you with other users
            with similar interests with these data points but ultimately, the purpose of this data is to serve you. I don't consider making money from the deployment
            of this website, even though these datapoints are quite highly valued by targeting adverstisors. This is a project for myself as well, as I hope to use this
            product myself. It is indeed modelled after how I felt I learnt the best, and as a user personally I wouldn't want any privacy breaches to occur.
